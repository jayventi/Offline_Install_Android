`https://github.com/jayventi/Offline_Install_Android/blob/master/FDroid.apk` 

Then the appropriate URL to download the file would be

`https://github.com/jayventi/Offline_Install_Android/raw/master/FDroid.apk`

`https://github.com/jayventi/Offline_Install_Android/raw/master/FDroid.zip`

Offline application installation can be performed using third-party applications which facilitate sending and receiving using technologies like Bluetooth. Most, are supported through in-app purchase or advertisement. However, there is an application which attempts to entirely replace Google Play as an open source marketplace for apps, F-Droid. F-Droid which is open source itself allows for the downloading of applications from non-Google play repositories but also between phones which already have F-Droid installed. One of its most exciting features is that it allows for the pulling of F-Droid itself to the receiving phone if it does not already have it. 

Follow the instructions at [How to Send and Receive Apps Offline](https://f-droid.org/en/tutorials/swap/) found at F-Droid tutorials.

Note: F-Droid must be side installed itself
